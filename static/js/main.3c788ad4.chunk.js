I learned to work smarter not harder, that Javascript can actually be fun, and that finding bugs in code is a lot better than examining real bugs in a laboratory as I had sometimes done in my previous roles as a biologist.

It has taught me to be flexible and agile (both in my own development style and in our team methodology). It has also taught me how to work in new code bases quickly, how to refactor other's code, and how to learn new tools or languages even faster than I had done in my bootcamp. I became the most proficient member of our team in Chart.js for React in less than a week after starting from zero knowledge. I learned Next.js on the fly while developing a new feature and still managed to deliver the front end ahead of schedule. From this experience I've gained a wealth of knowledge in a short period of time, both about myself and development, and look forward to applying this in my future endeavors.",Object(a.jsx)("hr",{className:"about__line"}),"Thanks for checking out my portfolio and for your interest in me and my work!
